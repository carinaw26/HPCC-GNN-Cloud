# TensorFlow Client Application
Due to time limit I didn't do much work on this topic. But it is important to develop the strategy for future work
Here are some thoughts

1. Convert trained model to TensorFlow Lite which can be imported to cell phone or mobile device
2. Convert trained model to TensorFlow.js (Javascript) which will be easy to be used in Web Application 
3. Create an application to use the trained model direct on PC or similar device which will be the case for AH Robot
